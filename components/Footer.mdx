Githubtrends is shamelessly inspired by [npmtrends](https://npmtrends.com). You can report bugs and request features on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/andrewsosa/githubtrends/issues).

Git history data is computed directly via `git clone` and only refreshed sparingly. Github statistics come directly from Github via client-side request.
